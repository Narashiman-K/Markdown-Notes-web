/**
 * Hostile-input tests for the converters, as in the MCP package's
 * tests/security.test.mjs.
 *
 * Every document the app reads comes from somewhere the user does not control
 * (an email attachment, a download, a shared drive), so the parsers are the
 * attack surface. What these pin:
 *   - the spreadsheet library is the patched release (prototype pollution,
 *     CVE-2023-30533, and the 2024 ReDoS are fixed from 0.20.2), installed from
 *     vendor/, so a future `npm install xlsx` that pulls 0.18.5 from the npm
 *     registry fails here rather than shipping;
 *   - a workbook built to pollute Object.prototype leaves it untouched;
 *   - spreadsheets cut off part-way, and corrupt or misnamed files, fail cleanly
 *     and quickly instead of throwing or hanging.
 *
 * Kept identical to the copy in the Windows app, apart from import paths.
